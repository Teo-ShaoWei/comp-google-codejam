    "Instead of chasing the exact value of $S_N$ for various $N$, we notice that the sequence always have the same value at corresponding index whenever they are generated. Thus we only care about the infinite string $S_\\infty$ where every index has a value generated. Equivalently, this defines a function $S : \\mathbb{Z}^+ \\to \\{ 0, 1 \\}$ whereby $S(k)$ is the value of $S_\\infty$ at index $k$.\n",
